        <h2>My internet just crashed so i'm just going to type stuff here.</h2>
        <p>I promised I'd add some content on this page to make it longer. this is a placeholder. I definitely wouldn't leave this here.
            what if i forgot to remove it? that would be embarassing! what if i wrote all my deepest thoughts? like...a diary. yeah. a diary.</p>

        <h2>thought number #1:</h2>
            <p>I think that Olive Garden should have a commercial featuring a new pesto dish. then they could cover that classic song "Best of My Love" by The Emotions. But change 
            the lyrics to "Pest-o My Love". Hey! Olive Garden! pay me.</p>

        <h2>thought #2:</h2>
            <p>the sequel: How has there not been a golf-themed slasher movie? guy with sharpened 5 iron...slicing (haha get it?) his way through the teenagers who work for the country club. someone pay me!</p>

        <h2>thought threeeeee:</h2>
        <p>"Never Too Much" by Luther Vandross is a great song. I don't expect any arguments here but I am prepared.</p>
        
        <h2>thought FORE:</h2>
        <p>oh dang. i should have made this one the golf slasher movie thing. that would have been funny.</p>

        <h2>five:</h2>
        <p>I can fix baseball. since people keep saying it needs to be fixed. but not "fix" like in gambling.
            
            1. the batter is now called "The Batman" and all helmets have pointy ears.
            2. if someone robs a home run...he's Robin.
            3. if the umpires must come together to discuss a confusing play...someone dressed as the Riddler sneaks around the stadium and offers a coupon
            for a free hot dog to a random fan once the play has been decided.
            4. .......
            5. Baseball has been fixed!
